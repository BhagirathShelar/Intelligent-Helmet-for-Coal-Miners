# Intelligent-Helmet-for-Coal-Miners
The present work is an attempt to analyze the safety scenario of a mine. This project focuses on a mine supervising system which is based on the cost effective IOT system.  Our project aims at developing a sensor networks, realized real-time surveillance with early-warning intelligence  on harmful gases and be easily available for the help of miner in panic situation. parameters are detected  continuously gas sensor and if they cross the predefined limit, then the user gets information about all the sensors  and it displays in control room and it will automatically updates the values.
